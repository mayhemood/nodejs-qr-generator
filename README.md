# nodejs-qr-generator
This turns any given URL to a QR-Code and saves a .txt file showing that URL.

The QR-Code(qr_img.png) is for my Personal Site "https://mayhemood.github.io/personal-site/".

Please download the files in a folder, and then in node.js runtime, write "npm i" or "npm install" to get all node_modules. Thank you.
